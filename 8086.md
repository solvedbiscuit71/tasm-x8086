# Multiplication and Division

```
MUL operand
```

1. operand is 8-bit, then al * operand => ax
2. operand is 16-bit, then ax * operand => dx:ax

```
DIV operand
```

1. operand is 8-bit, then ax / operand => al, ax % operand => ah
2. operand is 16-bit, then dx:ax / operand => ax, dx:ax % operand => dx
3. division by zero, leads to divide error
