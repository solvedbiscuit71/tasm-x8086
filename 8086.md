# Multiplication and Division

```
MUL operand
```

1. operand is 8-bit, then al * operand => ax
2. operand is 16-bit, then ax * operand => dx:ax

```
DIV operand
```

1. operand is 8-bit, then ax / operand => al, ax % operand => ah
2. operand is 16-bit, then dx:ax / operand => ax, dx:ax % operand => dx
3. division by zero, leads to divide error

# BCD Addition and Subtraction

```
DAA ; after ADD instruction
```

1. adjusts the `AL` register based on the flag register

```
DAS ; after SUB instruction
```

1. adjusts the `AL` register based on the flag register

# Interrupt

```
MOV AH, 01H
INT 21H
```

1. reads one character and stores it in `AL`

```
MOV AH, 02H
INT 21H
```

1. writes one character which is stored in `DL`

```
MOV AH, 09H
INT 21H
```

1. offset of the string is stored in `DX`
2. terminate on `$` character

```
.data
buffer db size, 0, size+1 dup('$')

MOV AH, 0AH
INT 21H
```

1. reads a buffered input until user click `enter` or size - 1 character entered
2. stores the input from the 3rd including the carriage return `0DH`
